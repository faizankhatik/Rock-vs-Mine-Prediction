     # Rock vs Mine Prediction
     
     This project uses machine learning to predict whether a sonar signal represents a rock or a mine. The prediction is based on a dataset containing 60 numeric features that capture the energy of a sonar signal bounced off an object. The target variable classifies the object as either a "Rock" or a "Mine".
     
     ## Project Overview
     
     The goal of this project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts the class (Rock or Mine) from the sonar signal data. The Jupyter Notebook `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` contains all the steps from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.
     
     ## Dataset
     
     - **Features**: 60 numerical values representing the sonar signal strength.
     - **Target**: A categorical variable indicating whether the object is a "Rock" or a "Mine".
     
     The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)).
     
     ## Technologies Used
     
     - Python 3
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - Pandas
     - NumPy
     - Scikit-learn
     - Matplotlib & Seaborn
     
     ## How to Run the Project
     
     1. **Clone the Repository**  
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.git
        cd Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
        ```
     
     2. **Install Dependencies**  
        Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you can install the necessary libraries manually:
        ```bash
        pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
        ```
     
     3. **Run the Notebook**  
        Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb`:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb
        ```
     
     ## Project Structure
     
     ```
     Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction/
     ├── Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb  # Main notebook with code and analysis
     ├── README.md                      # Project description and instructions
     └── requirements.txt               # List of dependencies (if available)
     ```
     
     ## Results
     
     The model achieves competitive accuracy in classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines. Detailed results, evaluation metrics, and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
     
     ## Future Work
     
     - Experiment with additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, SVM, Neural Networks).
     - Perform extensive hyperparameter tuning.
     - Deploy the model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.
